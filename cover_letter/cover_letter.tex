I would like to express my interest in the open position for a Proof Engineer in the Trusted Systems team. I believe my background makes me a suitable candidate.

As an undergraduate student at UNSW, my studies focused on theoretical computer science with an emphasis on language semantics and verification methods. I balanced this with some systems programming coursework, particularly the operating systems courses.

I continued this interest in semantics and verification in my part-time work with NICTA and Data61, first working with Dr. Franck Cassez on modelling techniques, and later with Dr. Toby Murray on security semantics. In my work with Dr. Murray I gained familiarity with Isabelle.

At Cog Systems I worked in small to medium-sized teams solving a variety of practical problems, while demonstrating an ability to quickly adapt to a range of development environments and tools.

Additionally, I have worked on both projects using modern development techniques such as version control and regression testing, as well as projects \textit{without} these techniques. I am now strongly motivated to promote and maintain the use of these techniques.

I've always been interested in models and correctness, and appreciate the utility of these concepts to software engineering. I would love the opportunity to further develop my skills in this area, while helping the wider adoption of formal methods in practice.
